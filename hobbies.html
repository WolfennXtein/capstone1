        <li>Scientific Research & Experimentation: <ul>
                <li>As a theoretical physicist, Gordon is likely passionate about science. While the Half-Life series
                    doesn’t delve deeply into his personal life, it’s reasonable to assume that he enjoys research,
                    experimentation, and exploring the unknown. He might have hobbies related to learning about new
                    scientific concepts or experimenting with technology—though his work at Black Mesa was not exactly
                    by choice!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2">
        <li>Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking:<ul>
                <li>hroughout the Half-Life series, Gordon is faced with numerous challenges, from fighting off alien
                    creatures to navigating complex environments. This suggests that he enjoys solving problems and
                    using his intellect to find solutions, which ties into his scientific background.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="3">
        <li>Technology and Engineering:<ul>
                <li>Gordon frequently uses advanced technology, from weapons to experimental equipment. This suggests an
                    interest in technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems, even in a
                    life-threatening situation.</li>
